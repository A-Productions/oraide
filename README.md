# `oraml2`

A proof-of-concept library implementing a lexer for OpenRA's MiniYaml
format based on [brendanzab's mltt-parse crate](https://github.com/brendanzab/rust-nbe-for-mltt/crates/mltt-parse/src/lexer.rs).

This project contains a simple executable target (`src/main.rs`) that you can easily run like so:

```
$ cargo run
```
