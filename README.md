# `oraide`

A collection of tools with the aim of lowering the barrier to entry for
[OpenRA]-based game development.

# ARCHIVED

My personal life is changing and as a result I have less time than ever to spend
on OpenRA.  I _may_, at some unknown point in the future, come back to OpenRA
for some time here and there.  Please feel free to fork and continue this work
without me.

The codebase is not well tested and should probably be rewritten from scratch
via TDD.  This was a great learning experience and I hope one day it helps
developers / game makers / modders / etc.

## Architecture

Read [./docs/dev/architecture.md] for an overview of
the _OpenRA IDE_ project architecture (this does *not* cover LSP clients).

## Contact Us

You can find the maintainer as _Phrohdoh#0436_ on [OpenRA's Discord server].

Be sure to read and understand the server rules before participating.

Do know that the OpenRA IDE project (also called `oraide`) is an unofficial
project, so you should probably ping me directly in the `#off-topic` channel.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have
questions/comments/concerns/praise/whatever!
