# `oraide-parser-miniyaml`

This package implements facilities to convert a textual MiniYaml document into a tree of nodes.

<small>In the future this may change to produce a forest (numerous trees) for a text document.</small>

Parsing is implemented in 3 _phases_:

- [Tokenization]
- [Nodeization]
- [Treeization]

<small>"Tokenization" is a "real" word but the others are made up with the intent of conveying what they do while being similar to "tokenization".</small>

[Nodeization]: ./docs/nodeization.md
[Treeization]: ./docs/treeization.md
