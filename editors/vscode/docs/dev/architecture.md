# _OpenRA IDE_ - Architecture

The `editors/vscode/` directory contains the Visual Studio Code extension (sometimes referred to as `oraide-vscode`).

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This document assumes you have read and understood the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overview) site (including the [spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)).

You don't have to be an LSP expert, but a basic understanding of the principles will be useful.

## Architecture

The [vscode-languageclient node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient), which is [open source](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node), is used to handle most of the heavy-lifting, such as sending messages to the server and receiving responses.  Yay for code reuse!

### Management of the Server Process

We spawn the server as a child process by searching the user's `$PATH` (or `%PATH%` for the Windows users, `$env:PATH` on PowerShell) for the `oraide-language-server` executable, unless the `oraide.server.exePath` configuration value is set, in which case we use the value provided (which can either be an executable's name or path).

This process is managed by the previously-mentioned `vscode-languageclient` package.

If communication with the server process is lost (if you kill the server with `kill -9 <server's pid>`, for example) the server will be re-launched and the initialization 'handshake' will happen again.

### Activation of the Extension

The _OpenRA IDE_ extension is activated when a document with a so-called _Language ID_ of `miniyaml` is opened.

By convention (and some hard-coding) OpenRA MiniYaml files have the `.yaml` extension so, for ease of use, we register `.yaml`, `.miniyaml`, and `.oraml` file types as having the _Language ID_ `miniyaml`.

This is done in 2 places:

- in [`extension.ts`](../../src/extension.ts) by setting `clientOptions.documentSelector`, to register extension activation
- in [`package.json`](../../package.json) at `contributes.languages`, to register the mentioned file types with the `miniyaml` _Language ID_

Some day we may want to only activate the extension if either a `mod.yaml` (a hard-coded file name in OpenRA) or `mod.config` (a file in the root of the [OpenRA SDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK)) are present.

## Command Registration

We then register the commands that the extension makes available to the user in our `registerCommands` function.

This is a simple process of calling `commands.registerCommand(id, fn)`.

```typescript
commands.registerCommand('oraide.server.restart', async () => {
    // code that restarts the server process
});
```

For each call to `commands.registerCommand` we need an associated object in the `package.json`'s `commands` list.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "command": "oraide.server.restart",
            "title": "Restart the OpenRA Language Server",
            "description": "Sometimes, it's just best to try turning it off and on again",
            "category": "OpenRA"
        }
    ],
}
```

Here you can see that `oraide.server.restart` is used in both places, it is what ties the function to the actual command the user can run.

When the user runs the _Restart the OpenRA Language Server_ command the function (`async () => { .. }`) will be invoked.
