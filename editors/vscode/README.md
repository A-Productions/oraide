# `oraide-vscode`

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) that aims to make modding easier, faster, and more intuitive.

---

## Installation

This extension is not yet available on [the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) so you must use the following command to build and install from source.

```
$ yarn install-ext
```

<details>
<summary>What does that command do?</summary>

Read the `scripts.install-ext` part of [`package.json`](./package.json) to learn more!

Alternatively, assuming you have [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed, the following command will print out the commands encompassed in the above command.

```
$ cat package.json | jq -r '.scripts."install-ext"'
```
</details>

You should now be able to find an extension named _OpenRA IDE_ in your VSCode _extensions_ viewlet's _enabled_ section.
